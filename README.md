# Bayesian Neural Network for Early Depression Prediction in Older Adults

This repository contains the implementation of a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) model for early depression prediction in older adults, with comprehensive analysis of humor styles, communication skills, and social physical activity experiences.

## Overview

This project develops a probabilistic machine learning approach using Bayesian Neural Networks to predict depression risk in older adults based on multidimensional behavioral and psychological factors. The model leverages uncertainty quantification to provide reliable predictions with confidence intervals.

## Research Background

Depression in older adults is a significant public health concern that often goes undetected in early stages. This study investigates the relationship between various psychological and behavioral factors and depression risk, focusing on:

- **Humor Styles**: Different types of humor usage and their psychological impact
- **Communication Skills**: Social communication abilities and interpersonal skills
- **Social Exercise Experiences**: Physical activity in social contexts and its mental health benefits

## Methodology

### Model Architecture
- **3-layer Bayesian Neural Network** with LeakyReLU activation
- **MCMC sampling** using No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) for posterior inference
- **Variational inference** for uncertainty quantification

### Data Processing
- **Target Variable**: K6 psychological distress scale (binary classification: <9 vs â‰¥9)
- **Features**: 
  - Numeric features: Age, exercise metrics, humor scores, communication skills
  - Categorical features: Gender, social exercise experiences
- **Preprocessing**: Min-Max scaling for numeric features

### Key Features
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Provides prediction confidence intervals
- **Feature Importance**: SHAP analysis for model interpretability
- **Threshold Optimization**: Optimized classification threshold for best F1-score
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Multiple metrics including precision, recall, F1-score
